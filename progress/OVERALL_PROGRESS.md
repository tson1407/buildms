## Next Steps
1. **Priority Modules:** Start with USER (User Management) for role-based access, then INV (Inventory) for core operations
2. **Business Logic:** Implement INB, OUT, TRF, MOV for warehouse operations
3. **Sales Integration:** Add SO (Sales Orders) and CUS (Customers) for complete workflow

## Implementation Notes
- All completed modules follow the MVC pattern with Jakarta EE 10
- Role-based access control enforced via AuthFilter
- JSP views use JSTL/EL exclusively (no scriptlets)
- Database operations use prepared statements for security
- Password hashing implemented with SHA-256 + salt
