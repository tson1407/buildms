2. **Transfer Requests:** Add TRF (Transfers) for inter-warehouse movement
3. **Testing & Refinement:** Integration testing across all modules

## Implementation Notes
- All completed modules follow the MVC pattern with Jakarta EE 10
- Role-based access control enforced via AuthFilter
- JSP views use JSTL/EL exclusively (no scriptlets)
- Database operations use prepared statements for security
- Password hashing implemented with SHA-256 + salt
